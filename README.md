# Counterfeit Currency Detection using CNN and ResNet

Counterfeit currency poses a significant threat to the integrity of the monetary system. This project proposes a method for detecting counterfeit banknotes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet architecture.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a CNN model based on the ResNet50 architecture that can accurately detect fake currency. The model will be trained on a dataset of images captured from mobile devices, making data collection more convenient and accessible. By leveraging transfer learning and ResNet50, this deep learning approach aims to improve accuracy and reduce dependence on human-engineered features.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**: Gather a dataset of banknote images containing both genuine and counterfeit banknotes.

2. **Preprocessing**: Enhance the banknote images by applying preprocessing techniques to highlight relevant features and prepare them for training the CNN model.

3. **Model Training**: Train a CNN model using the ResNet50 architecture, a powerful deep learning framework known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained CNN model by measuring its accuracy in detecting counterfeit banknotes. Compare the results with existing state-of-the-art methods.

## Advantages

- **High Accuracy**: The proposed CNN model achieves a high accuracy in distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit banknotes, even when the counterfeit notes are sophisticated and difficult to detect.

- **Efficient Computing**: By utilizing the ResNet architecture, the model can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately while requiring low computational power.

- **Real-World Applicability**: The proposed method is practical for use in various settings, including banking institutions, retail stores, and other venues where counterfeit currency may be present.

## Challenges

- **Dataset**: Acquiring a large and diverse dataset of banknote images is crucial for training a robust model.

- **Mobile Device Image Quality**: Dealing with potential issues related to image quality captured from mobile devices may pose challenges in achieving accurate detection.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder directory for storing the banknote image dataset.
- `preprocessing.py`: Python script for image preprocessing and feature enhancement.

- **Mobile Application Integration**: Develop a mobile application or website that utilizes the trained CNN model for real-time counterfeit currency detection.

## Conclusion

The proposed approach presents a significant improvement in counterfeit currency detection using deep learning methods. Leveraging the ResNet architecture allows for high accuracy while utilizing low computational power, making the method suitable for real-world applications. By improving the accessibility and accuracy of fake currency detection, this project contributes to safeguarding the integrity of the monetary system.
